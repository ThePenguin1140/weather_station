# RRD4J custom datasource for weather station (4-30 minute update interval)
# Items listed here use this datasource instead of default_quantifiable.
# Format: GAUGE,heartBeat,minValue,maxValue,sampleInterval
# heartBeat=3600 (60 min) so readings up to ~30 min apart are accepted.
# sampleInterval=60 (seconds) base step for sparse data.
weather.def=GAUGE,3600,U,U,60
# Archives: AVERAGE,xff,samplesPerBox,boxCount (step=60s)
# 24h at 1min, 7d at 6min, ~1y at 15min, ~5y at 1h, ~10y at 1d
